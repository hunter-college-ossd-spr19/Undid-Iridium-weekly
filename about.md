### General Information

My name is Francis X Irizarry, and I will be graduating in Spring 2019. I enjoy designing projects from the ground up, and developing using tools created by others. I don't personally have a direct interest in one particular topic as all topics are interesting. If told to learn about data analytics I would, and then if told to learn about machine learning I would. No topics is too broad or too far reached to understand, just takes time.
