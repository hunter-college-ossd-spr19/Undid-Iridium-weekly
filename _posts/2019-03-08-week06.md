### OpenSource NY

This week we began to involve ourselves int he choices of project we had decided last week. In this process we had to start organizing with each other to figure out what we had to accomplish in order to produce a product that would be substantial. In this thought; however, I had not been added to the slack nor repository until a significant period afterwards, I was placed into the second group that seems to have to be involved with the work instead of the API (which is a simple API, as are most). I believe I should get more involved with my teammates and their abilities as I know at least one person the team two that is very skilled in general programming/front end. As for developing for MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node JS) my experience is limited, I do not prefer front end, nor do I enjoy it; however, as all programming goes, it's just another tool to learn. I have created offline mern setups for not only my capstone but also for this class thereby allowing me to improve my understanding on how to produce curl requests, and create RESTful API's that can be called.
