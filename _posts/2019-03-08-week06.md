### OpenSource NY

This week we began to involve ourselves int he choices of project we had decided last week. In this process we had to start organizing with each other to figure out what we had to accomplish in order to produce a product that would be substantial. In this thought; however, I had not been added to the slack nor repository until a significant period afterwards, I was placed into the second group that seems to have to be involved with the work instead of the API (which is a simple API, as are most). I believe I should get more involved with my teammates and their abilities as I know at least one person the team two that is very skilled in general programming/front end. As for developing for MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node JS) my experience is limited, I do not prefer front end, nor do I enjoy it; however, as all programming goes, it's just another tool to learn. I have created offline mern setups for not only my capstone but also for this class thereby allowing me to improve my understanding on how to produce curl requests, and create RESTful API's that can be called.

Luckily, as time has passed I was given more work to do, which was to keep integrating the backend, in which:
```node
/* Our front line of communication, clients will access this page first for any requests */

const express = require('express');
const MongoClient  = require('mongodb').MongoClient;//Used to create database for information to go to, online resource.
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const db = require('config/db');//Used to link to the config of DataBase
var cors = require('cors')
var app = express();
const port = 5000;
const response = require('./response.js');
const handleListen = require('./handleListen.js');
//https://github.com/expressjs/cors

app.use(bodyParser.json({limit: '100mb'}));
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({limit: '100mb', extended: true}));
app.use(cors());



console.log("Hello");

const client = new MongoClient(db.uri, { useNewUrlParser: true });
client.connect(err => {
  const collection = client.db("openSourceRepos").collection("openSourceRepos");
  const { assessmentRoutes, initAssessmentRoutes } = require('database_route.js');
  initAssessmentRoutes({db : collection});
  if (err) return console.log(err)
   app.use('/dbRoute', assessmentRoutes);
});
// Let app start listening to port, will output error if anything goes wrong
app.listen( port, handleListen(console.log, port) );      
  app.get('/', response.hello);
  app.get( '/express_backend', response.express_backend);


// Our API and their approtiate functions
```

Some of the issues I ran into whilst doing this part of the open-ny project was data handling, there was sometimes a lot of data that needed to be pushed through which resulted in a lot of unknown errors. Luckily after looking up enough information and doing research of my own I learned to allocate more memory for json request thereby allowing the massive repository data to be parsed!
