# Week 11

### Open source personalties/wiki

This week, we were instructed to read about personalities in open source, and to considered how one would design communities that are inclusive of people with many different personalities. The article [Have You Seen These Personalities in Open Source](https://opensource.com/open-organization/18/11/design-communities-personality-types?utm_campaign=intrel) goes into detail about how one community may be mindful of traits of the many people in the community. That a community should have both public and private communication channels to adhere to many types of individual preferences, process and work flows that would help people who are more prone to a time table and those who are more adaptable. Documentation and contribution guidelines would help those who need certainty but also allow those who are more loose with their interests to know how to focus their efforts. 

I worked on and submitted the part I was given for the Open Source Application. It is under review.
