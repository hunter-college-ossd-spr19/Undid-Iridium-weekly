# Week 12

### Wikipedia edits, and external work.

This week, I made two edits on an alternative account to Wikipedia's. I intend to go back unto my main account to ensure that there are at least five edits to improve the grammatical structure of the Wikipedia's articles I find. The process to edit a Wikipedia's page is quite easy, and they have a system in place to allow individuals to search for articles that are likely in need of revision and or overhaul.
