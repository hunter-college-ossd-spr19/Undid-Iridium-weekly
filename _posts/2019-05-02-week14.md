## Final week.
### May 2, 2019


This weeks focuses was on the style difference between the cathedral and the bazzar style of development. In a cathedral style individuals usually are highly skilled and contribute in a small, isolated space. While this method works well, it takes a very long time and may be prone to more issues. The alternative is the bazzar which references the idea of a market bazzar where individuals go around shopping. In software development the more specific understanding of this is that those who follow the cathedral design usually have closed source work where only those who are working on the specific project have access to read and change things. The public is unaware of the inner workings and use the product under the assumption those who created it knew how to build it. However, the alternative is the bazzar which focuses on open source implementation, the ideology that "with many eyes all bugs are shallow" as if many people focus on a project there is a higher likelihood there will be those who are technically skilled, able to find problems, and willing to contribute to it. With many people contributing small parts to a project, an even larger system can be created.
