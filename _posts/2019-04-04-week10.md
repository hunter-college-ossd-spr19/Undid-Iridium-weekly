# Week 10

### Gitflow/Open Source Project/Development/Unix Knowledge

This week we focused on reading the guides to contributing to Wikipedia, mostly focused on an overview of the customs, norms, and allowed behaviors for Wikipedia editors, and a introduction for Newcomers (A small guide to contribute if you are new). In addition we focused on developing our knowledge of unix in class, and had a test on Friday ( I was not able to come in as a result of external reasons that will not be discussed here for legality reasons). It was relatively useful to learn more about wikipedia as I did last semester, and the unix knowledge we are getting in class is without a doubt going to be extremely helpful. 

As for the Open Source project, I did put more time into working on part; however, my capstone, cloud engineering, and TTP request has eaten a lot more of my time than I expected so I will be working and finishing my part this week. I apologize for the delay.
