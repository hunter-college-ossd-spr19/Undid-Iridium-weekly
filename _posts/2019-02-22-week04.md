## More Git, More collaboration, and Open Source contribution!
### February 22th, 2019


This week we were introduced to more information regarding git, git flow, and how to utilize these tools for collaboration with other individuals. We also were paired into groups to handle different activities including to determine or rather garner information regarding specific open source projects so that we can get an idea on how to find relative information about activity, contribution, and what language the projects are in. Furthermore, Hunter college as well as NYU were offered an opportunity to contribute to a project to help push open source awareness to people in the same fashion octoberhack did which was to keep a record of pull requests!. I intend to contribute to this as I believe it is a great idea to help push people to want to contribute to open source projects. I solemnly believe people react better to positive reinforcement rather than negative reinforcement therefore this will likely make people more interested. This project; however, would not be my 100% priority as my capstone project is extremely large, as well as my Cloud computing class (Which is a cross listed graduate class), as well as my other classes. I will put effort into these projects; however, I cannot guarantee my full effort.
