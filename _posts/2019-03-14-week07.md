# Week 7

### Open Source Project Thoughts/Open Source Project/Integration

This week we started to contribute to the open source projects we agreed on, in my case I agreed to begin to involve myself in the open source application. At the current time I had been reading and following the comments in the slack regarding the progress that needs to be followed, and the current position the project is in; however, I don't see much organization. It seems that it will be up to whatever becomes available.  

Patrick Masson, General Manager of the Board of Directors at OSI spoke to us regarding open source. He explain his own reasoning for his interests, why open source is important, licenses, contributing, and the community of open source. He also expanded on the aspect of organizations making money from services that support the open source code. Companies can/have paid for people who contribute to open source to prioritize certain bugs as a reward system. This greatly corresponds with the videos and talks regarding open source that have happened thus far, most of which being during C++ panels.   

Furthermore, Github workflow activity was done during this time, not much to say other than if you can google then you can do anything anyone else has done
