## GIT + Projects
### February 14th, 2019

We have not done much work this week, we will discuss projects and their evaluations in class 2/15. I believe I will have had picked a good project by the time I arrive in class with information regarding this. I have been dealing with other classes which have taken a good amount of my time, specifically capstone. I personally enjoy the git excerises we do in class, and look forward to future ones with my classmates.
