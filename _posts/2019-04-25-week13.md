# Week 13

### Work, Work, Work.

So, I am taking multiple classes this semester. Open Source, Cloud Computing (Cross-Listed Graduate Class), Symbolic Logic, Statistics, Capstone, Spanish. While I don't feel particularly overloaded, I do know that I have a lot of work to do. I have spent more of my break catching up on projects I needed to do to ensure I get good grades in my classes. However, a majority of my break was used to work on a TTP application so that I could more easily get job opportunities. I had to build a stock website application for users to buy stocks, check their transactions, and to maintain their accounts. This process created a situation where I had the opportunity to learn new resources: React, Redux, JWTToken, and States. This was extremely annoying in my personal opinion because I really prefer backend. A lot of work can be done in the backend to handle logical issues, and implentations; however, front end is normally just regurgatating previous implementations of work in a nicer way. However, after presenting my project and answering a technical question I am happy to have been put into the pool to receive job noticies and opportunities. Therefore, I suppose it was worth it!
