# Week 9

### Gitflow/Open Source Project/Development

This week I began to work on the backend of OSNY. I was tasked in setting up secure paths/routes for our express background utilizing mongodb to functionally keep records of individuals based on their user-name, and the repositories they've contributed to. At this point I will begin to test the utility of the design, and whether it can be used in the correct fashion based on the requirements given to me by the main contributors of OSNY. As for the difficulty of the part, it is not particularly hard. An example can be shown from my capstone project

```js
const express        = require('express');//In order to use express to create simple framework
const MongoClient    = require('mongodb').MongoClient;//Used to create database for information to go to, online resource.
const bodyParser     = require('body-parser');//Used to correctly parse URLs
const db             = require('./config/db');//Used to link to the config of DataBase
const app            = express();//Server (APP) set to express
const hostname = '127.0.0.1';//Run IP
const http = require('https');//Protocol (Should be https)
var url = require('url'); //Get Urls

const port = 8000;

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));


//Connect to MongoDB database.
MongoClient.connect(db.url, (err, database) => {
  if (err) return console.log(err)
  require('./app/routes/cryptoIndex.js')(app, database);//Load routes to use functionality from other files (app._action)
	app.listen(port, hostname, () => { //start server
        console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
    });               
})

//Default loading of page.
app.get('/',(request,response)=>{
 response.sendFile(__dirname + '/index.html');
});
```

However, there seems to be new functionality with the version of express that is used for the OSNY project which utilizes routers which I did not necessarily use in the same fashion. I will work on my part and see if I can follow the path laid out by the other contributors.
