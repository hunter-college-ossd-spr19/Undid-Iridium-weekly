# Week 8

### Gitflow/Open Source Project/Development

So, This week we focused on finishing up our gitflow activities, and to begin to develop on Open Source project. To be honest, I have still not contributed to it.. There's no organization and it seems I should just build it myself with the way organization is done. I mean, I really do not prefer front-end development; however, as a result of doing my capstone project which utilizes a mern architecture (which is very easy to make). It utilizes MongoDB (NoSQL), Express (Framework for server), React (Front-end Design), NodeJS (Back-End Design). Honestly, I need to start figuring out what the current issues are, and start talking to the current members of the project more. I don't know what's going on, and it's my fault. 

As for contributions, there are non currently. I will be looking into getting more involved.
